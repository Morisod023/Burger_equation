Hello, 

this is "server" created using the document on my Github account.
It is a temporary solution to the fact that my notebook uses packages I installed on my personnal computer.
Once it is loaded, you can access the notebook by clicking on the files with the extension .ipynb

You'll have to "install" the packages that are needed for the good operation of the notebook, by executing the 
first cell as "code". You will find some instruction on the notebook. 
After it is done (approx 5 min of installation), you can set the first cell as "Markdown". By doing so, it'll not
be executed each time. 

If you want the presentation mode, you have to reload the page. Note that the installation of the package is done
at that state. You don't have to redo it. 
The slideshow mode can be accesible by clicking on the diagram button, once the packages are installed
(the slide show requires one of the packages).
